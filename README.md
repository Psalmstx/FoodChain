# FoodChain üçΩÔ∏è

A decentralized restaurant review and reputation system built on the Stacks blockchain using Clarity smart contracts.

## Overview

FoodChain enables restaurants to register on-chain and allows customers to submit verified reviews that cannot be manipulated or deleted. The system maintains transparent reputation scores and ensures authentic feedback through blockchain immutability.

## Features

- **Restaurant Registration**: Restaurants can register with their details (name, cuisine type, location)
- **Decentralized Reviews**: Users can submit rated reviews (1-5 stars) with comments
- **Reputation System**: Automatic calculation of average ratings and review counts
- **Multi-Token Reward System**: STX token rewards for high-quality reviewers and restaurant loyalty programs
- **Reviewer Rewards**: Earn STX tokens for submitting high-quality reviews (4+ stars)
- **Loyalty Programs**: Customers earn rewards for frequent visits to restaurants
- **One Review Per User**: Prevents spam by allowing only one review per user per restaurant
- **Owner Controls**: Restaurant owners can toggle their active status
- **Transparent Data**: All reviews and ratings are publicly verifiable on-chain
