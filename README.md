# FoodChain üçΩÔ∏è

A decentralized restaurant review and reputation system built on the Stacks blockchain using Clarity smart contracts.

## Overview

FoodChain enables restaurants to register on-chain and allows customers to submit verified reviews that cannot be manipulated or deleted. The system maintains transparent reputation scores and ensures authentic feedback through blockchain immutability.

## Features
